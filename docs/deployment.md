# Exhibit — Deployment

Get Exhibit running in Docker in about 5 minutes.

## 1. Run it

```bash
docker build -t exhibit .
docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 \
  -e AUTH_TOKEN=changeme \
  -e APP_ORIGIN=https://app.example.com \
  -e RENDER_ORIGIN=https://artifacts.example.com \
  -v exhibit-data:/data \
  exhibit
```

Open `APP_ORIGIN`. Two ports: `8080` is the gallery/API, `8081` is where artifacts
render — they must be different origins (put them on different hostnames behind
your proxy; see §4).

For local/dev use, `docker compose up` works with no flags (defaults to
`localhost` origins and `dev-token`).

## 2. Configuration

Env vars, all optional except `AUTH_TOKEN` for anything beyond localhost:

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `AUTH_TOKEN` | `dev-token` | API bearer token — **change this** |
| `APP_ORIGIN` | `http://localhost:8080` | Public URL of the gallery/API |
| `RENDER_ORIGIN` | `http://localhost:8081` | Public URL of the artifact renderer (must differ from `APP_ORIGIN`) |
| `DATA_DIR` | `./data` | Where the SQLite DB + blobs live |
| `ADDR` | `:8080` | App listen address |
| `RENDER_ADDR` | `:8081` | Render listen address |
| `LOG_LEVEL` / `DEBUG` | `info` | `debug`/`info`/`warn`/`error`; `DEBUG=1` forces debug |
| `PI_BIN` | `pi` | AI agent executable — unset/missing just disables that feature |
| `EXHIBIT_SECRET` | auto | Encrypts stored agent API keys; auto-generated if unset |
| `MOCK_LLM_URL` | unset | Testing only, leave unset |

## 3. No AI agent features

Nothing to configure — if `pi` isn't on `PATH`, the agent surface disables itself
automatically. To shrink the image too, drop the AI stuff at build time by
swapping `Dockerfile`'s runtime stage:

```dockerfile
FROM gcr.io/distroless/static-debian12
COPY --from=builder /bin/server /server
VOLUME ["/data"]
ENV DATA_DIR=/data ADDR=:8080 RENDER_ADDR=:8081
EXPOSE 8080 8081
ENTRYPOINT ["/server"]
```

(Keep the `assets` and `builder` stages as-is.)

## 4. Reverse proxy / TLS

Bring your own (Caddy, nginx, Traefik, a cloud LB). Exhibit speaks plain HTTP;
point your proxy's two hostnames at `APP_ORIGIN`/`RENDER_ORIGIN` and terminate
TLS there. They must be different hostnames — that's the artifact sandbox
boundary, not just cosmetics.

## 5. Backups (optional)

`docker-compose.yml` includes a `replication` profile that runs Litestream
(streams the SQLite WAL to S3). You'll need your own `litestream.yml` (not
included) and `LITESTREAM_ACCESS_KEY_ID`/`LITESTREAM_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`/
`LITESTREAM_BUCKET_URL`. Skip this to start — plain SQLite on a mounted volume
is fine until you need it.

More detail: `architecture.md` (why two origins), `security.md` (CSP/sandbox
policy), `agent.md` (the AI agent sidecar).
